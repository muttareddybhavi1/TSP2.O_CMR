#div
A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling.  You most frequently use it to divide your page content into digestible blocks. A block element is a page element that starts a new line and has a width equal to the entire page or the parent container.

<div id=“paragraphs”>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is my second paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is my final paragraph.</p>    
</div>

#span

Span is a generic inline element often used to apply styling to a portion of content. An inline element does not start a new line and only takes up as much space on the page as its content. Span tags are used on small segments of text, links, images, and other HTML elements that appear inline with the surrounding content.

<p>This is a paragraph with <span id=“special-text”>a little something extra</span> inside it.</p>
